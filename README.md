## ♻️ Waste Image Classification using Deep Learning 🌱

### 📖 Overview
This project is an **AI-powered Waste Classification System** that classifies images of waste products into **Organic** or **Recyclable** categories using **Deep Learning**.
It helps promote **environmental sustainability** by suggesting **eco-friendly disposal tips** based on the predicted waste type.

---

### 🚀 Features
✅ Classifies waste into **Organic** and **Recyclable** categories  
✅ Uses **Transfer Learning (VGG16)** for high-accuracy classification  
✅ Provides **eco-friendly tips** for responsible waste management  
✅ Implements **callbacks** like `EarlyStopping`, `ModelCheckpoint`, and `ReduceLROnPlateau` for efficient training  
✅ Built using **TensorFlow** and **Keras**

### 🧠 Tech Stack
- **Programming Language:** Python  
- **Libraries & Frameworks:** TensorFlow, Keras, NumPy, Matplotlib, OpenCV  
- **Model:** VGG16 (Transfer Learning)  
- **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab

---

### 🧩 Workflow
1. **Data Preparation:**
   - Extract and preprocess dataset  
   - Apply real-time augmentation using `ImageDataGenerator`
2. **Model Training:**
   - Load pre-trained **VGG16** model  
   - Add custom dense layers for classification  
   - Compile and train the model with optimized parameters
3. **Prediction & Output:**
   - User uploads a waste image  
   - Model predicts **Organic** or **Recyclable**  
   - System displays appropriate **eco-friendly tips**

### 📂 Dataset Structure
The dataset used in this project is organized as follows:
```
DATASET/
 ├── TRAIN/
 │    ├── O/   → Organic waste images  
 │    └── R/   → Recyclable waste images  
 └── TEST/
      ├── O/   → Organic test images  
      └── R/   → Recyclable test images
```
🧾 Each folder contains hundreds of labeled images of organic and recyclable waste materials.

---

### 📊 Results
- Achieved **high classification accuracy** on validation data  
- Optimized model using **EarlyStopping** and **ReduceLROnPlateau**  
- Model performs effectively on unseen waste images

---

### 🌍 Impact
This project promotes **smart waste management** and environmental awareness using AI.
It demonstrates how **Deep Learning** can be applied to solve **real-world sustainability challenges**.

---

### 🔮 Future Enhancements
- Add more waste categories (e.g., hazardous, compostable, electronic)  
- Deploy as a **web or mobile application**  
- Integrate with **IoT-enabled smart bins** for automated waste sorting
